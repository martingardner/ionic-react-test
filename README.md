# ionic-react-test
testing ionic 4 + react

#instructions
- instructions from https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/your-first-app

# notes
- you need to make sure your ionic version is 5+ or type=react won't be recognized
- make sure your node and npm version is relatively up to date.  I initially ran into an issue with one of the dependencies not being found but updating my npm version and reinstalling everything fixed the issue.
